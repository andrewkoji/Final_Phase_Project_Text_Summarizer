    "In this study, we will be analyzing CNN-Daily Mail News Articles. Many companies want to keep track of the latest news trends and reading full length articles can be incredibly time consuming. With the way news headlines affect major business decisions such as legal matters and stock prices, its important that readers are able to obtain all the information and reasoning behind the purpose of these articles and many of them can have a large number of distractors. It's essential that companies that get this information have the ability to quickly analyze these articles and develop counter intel or reports of their own in order to stay current and relevant with today's media. In this study we take the first steps towards utilizing text summarization to fast track the information gathering and counter-reporting process. \n"

    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information age, staying updated with news and information is crucial for both individuals and businesses. However, the sheer volume of news articles published daily can be overwhelming. Reading and processing these articles is time-consuming, especially when trying to gather insights from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose the development of a text summarization model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model will automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of news articles. Here's how it can benefit the public and support business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Time Efficiency`: People often struggle to find the time to read lengthy news articles. Automated summarization allows individuals to quickly grasp the key points of an article, saving them time while keeping them informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Enhanced Understanding`: Summaries provide a condensed version of the article, making complex topics more accessible to a wider audience. This can help people better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multi-source Insights`: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of a topic, fostering critical thinking and a broader perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Competitive Intelligence`: Businesses can use automated summarization to track news and developments in their industry, enabling them to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to market changes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Market Research`: Summarization can assist in analyzing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies by summarizing customer reviews, news, and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Content Curation`: Media companies and content aggregators can use summarization to curate content for their audience, improving user engagement and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamline and automate the understanding of complex news topics. \n",
    "2. Help track news developments to enhance market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What specific NLP techniques or models can be employed to automate the process of summarizing complex news articles effectively?\n",
    "- How can automation be leveraged to provide real-time updates on important news developments to users or clients?\n",
    "- Are there opportunities to use automation to personalize news content delivery based on individual user preferences and interests?\n",
    "- How can automated summarization and analysis be integrated into other tools or platforms, such as news aggregators or chatbots?\n",
    "- What are the critical news sources, categories, or keywords that have the most significant impact on market trends and consumer sentiment?\n",
    "\n",

    "- `Relevance`: The model should focus on relevant and impactful information to meet the needs of the business case, ensuring that the summaries provide insights that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Structure`: The generated summaries should be well-structured, possibly using bullet points or other formatting techniques to enhance readability and quick comprehension.\n",

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

By iterating through the 'cleaned_summary' column of the DataFrame and checking the number of words in each cleaned summary, the code helps identify how many of these summaries are concise, containing 75 words or less. This analysis is valuable in various natural language processing and text analysis tasks, such as text summarization or information retrieval, as it provides an understanding of the dataset's summarization patterns. Furthermore, it allows data practitioners to assess the suitability of the dataset for specific applications that may have constraints on summary length."

    "### Sentence scoring using tf-idf is one of the extractive approaches for text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "`In TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)` text summarization, sentence scoring involves evaluating the importance of each sentence in a document. It does this by considering the frequency of words in the sentence (Term Frequency) and the uniqueness of those words across the entire document collection (Inverse Document Frequency). Sentences containing rare and important terms receive higher scores, making them more likely to be included in the summary. This aids in text summarization by selecting sentences that capture the key concepts and information, resulting in a concise and informative summary.\n",
    "- **TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency** — Inverse Document Frequency. It is the product of two statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)** : It is the number of times the word occurs in the document.\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** : It is the measure of how much information the word provides, i.e., if it’s common or rare across all documents.\n",

    "2. Pre-process text : Clean the sentences by removing unnecessary words, stopwords, punctuations, etc.\n",
    "3. Create term frequency (tf) matrix : It shows the frequency of words in each sentence. We will calculate relative frequency to represent the tf instead of using actual frequency. \n",
    ">It is calculated as t / T where,\n",
    "> - t = Number of times the term appears in the document,\n",
    "> - T = Total number of terms in the document\n",
    "4. Create idf matrix : It shows the importance of words in each sentence with respect to the whole document. \n",
    "> It is calculated as log_e(D/d) where,\n",
    "> - D = Total number of documents,\n",
    "> - d = Number of documents with term t in it\n",
    "5. Calculate sentence tf-idf : It is the product of tf and idf for each word in the sentence and shows the importance of each word in the sentence.\n",
    "6. Calculate sentence scores : Here score of the sentences are calculated as the average of the tf-idf value of words in the sentence. It is calculated as\n",
    "> T / n where,\n",
    "> - T = Total tf-idf of words in the sentence,\n",
    "> - n = Number of distinct words in the sentence\n",
    "7. Determine threshold : Threshold is the average value of the scores of the sentences. \n",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\n",

More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking?

    "\n",
    "- Assesses Content Overlap: ROUGE-L recall evaluates how well the generated summary captures the most important content from the reference summary. It ensures that the key information in the original text is retained in the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Considers Sequencing: It takes into account the order in which words appear in the summaries. This means that not only should the same words be present, but they should also be arranged in a coherent and logical sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emphasizes Quality: ROUGE-L recall prioritizes the quality of the summary over its length. It encourages the generation of concise summaries that faithfully represent the source text's essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to Substantial Content: Longer common subsequences are more likely to represent significant content. ROUGE-L recall ensures that the most vital parts of the text are included in the summary, helping to maintain its informativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performance Assessment: In the context of summarization, evaluating recall is crucial because it measures how well the system remembers and includes critical information. This is a fundamental aspect of evaluating the overall effectiveness of a summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, ROUGE-L recall is a vital metric in text summarization as it assesses content fidelity, structure, and the ability to capture essential information, aligning well with the objectives of text summarization."

    "## Analysis - Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures the proportion of relevant information that our summarization model successfully captures from the source articles and presents in the generated summaries. In our business case, a higher recall score indicates that our model is effective at retrieving and including important content from news articles in the summaries. This is crucial as it ensures that readers and businesses are well-informed and that the generated summaries are a valuable source of information.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROUGE-L Recall Score (0.3002): The ROUGE-L Recall score of 0.3002 indicates that our summarization model captures approximately 30.02% of the content present in the reference \"highlights.\" This signifies that TFIDF model is fairly effective at recalling important content from the reference summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Retrieval: A higher ROUGE-L Recall score suggests that our summarization model is successful at retrieving critical information and core concepts from the source CNN/DailyMail articles. It aligns with our goal of efficiently summarizing news content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Understanding: The ROUGE-L Recall score suggests that the summaries generated by our model provide a substantial amount of information that is present in the reference \"highlights.\" This is valuable for enhancing the understanding of complex news topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supporting Market Research: For our goal of enhancing market research, a higher ROUGE-L Recall score is beneficial. It implies that our model is adept at capturing market-relevant information from the source articles, which is essential for tracking news developments and gaining insights into the business environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Access and Time Efficiency: The high ROUGE-L Recall score indicates that our summarization model efficiently retrieves essential information. This can save time for individuals and businesses as they quickly grasp key points from news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Understanding: The model's ability to capture content from the \"highlights\" enhances the accessibility of complex topics. This is beneficial for individuals looking to better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Critical Thinking and Broader Perspective: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to gain a well-rounded view of a topic. This promotes critical thinking and a broader perspective, aligning with our business case's goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Intelligence and Adaptation: The high ROUGE-L Recall score indicates that businesses can effectively use the generated summaries for competitive intelligence and market research. Staying updated on industry developments and adapting to market changes becomes more feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Research and Content Curation: Summarization supports market research by summarizing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies. Additionally, it facilitates content curation for media companies and content aggregators, ultimately improving user engagement and retention.\n",

    "# Iteration 2 - Seq2Seq (Run in Google Colab)\n",
    "The next iteration of modeling that was deployed was an RNN Seq2Seq Model using google colab. The use of google colab was necessary due to the high RAM needs of running the model itself. Here is a description of the modeling process that was used in the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attention Layer\n",
    "An attention layer is a critical component in modern neural network architectures, particularly in sequence-to-sequence models, and it plays a fundamental role in enhancing the model's ability to focus on specific parts of input data. Here's an explanation of the concept of an attention layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Purpose of Attention: The primary purpose of an attention layer is to enable a neural network to \"pay attention\" to different parts of the input sequence when making predictions. It allows the model to assign varying degrees of importance or relevance to different elements in the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequences and Alignment: Attention layers are commonly used in tasks involving sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. When processing sequences, it's important to consider the alignment between the elements of the input and output sequences. The attention mechanism helps in aligning these sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mechanism: The attention mechanism works by computing a weighted sum of the elements in the input sequence, where the weights are dynamically determined based on the context of the current decoding step. In other words, it identifies which parts of the input sequence are most relevant for generating the current output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculation of Attention Weights: Attention weights are calculated by comparing the current state of the model (decoder) to each element in the input sequence. These comparisons are often performed using a similarity function, such as dot product or cosine similarity. The results are then transformed into probabilities using a softmax function, making them sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Performance: Attention mechanisms have significantly improved the performance of sequence-to-sequence models in various NLP tasks.\n",
    "- Handling Variable-Length Sequences: Attention allows the model to handle input sequences of variable length and generate output sequences of varying length.\n",
    "- Improved Interpretability: Attention mechanisms provide insights into which parts of the input data are influential in making specific predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is a type of neural network architecture designed for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text summarization. The primary purpose of a Seq2Seq model is to transform input sequences into output sequences of varying lengths. In the context of text summarization, it's used to convert long articles or documents into shorter, coherent summaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of the steps involved in preparing, building, and deploying a Seq2Seq model for encoder-decoder text summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Building the Seq2Seq Model - 3 Stacked LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets first have a look at a visual of how an LSTM model looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "![encoder_decoder](./images/enncoder_decoder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Return Sequences = True`: When the return sequences parameter is set to True, LSTM produces the hidden state and cell state for every timestep\n",
    "- `Return State = True`: When return state = True, LSTM produces the hidden state and cell state of the last timestep only\n",
    "- `Initial State`: This is used to initialize the internal states of the LSTM for the first timestep\n",
    "- `latent_dim`: It denotes the number of hidden units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model took over 2 hours to run and was done in google colab due to the high RAM demand. Here is a snapshot of the model summary:\n",
    "\n",

Additionally, it's important to note that ROUGE scores are just one way to evaluate summarization quality, and human evaluation and context-specific criteria are often necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance."
