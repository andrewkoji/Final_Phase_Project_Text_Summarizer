    "In this study, we will be analyzing CNN-Daily Mail News Articles. Many companies want to keep track of the latest news trends and reading full length articles can be incredibly time consuming. With the way news headlines affect major business decisions such as legal matters and stock prices, its important that readers are able to obtain all the information and reasoning behind the purpose of these articles and many of them can have a large number of distractors. It's essential that companies that get this information have the ability to quickly analyze these articles and develop counter intel or reports of their own in order to stay current and relevant with today's media. In this study we take the first steps towards utilizing text summarization to fast track the information gathering and counter-reporting process. \n"

    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information age, staying updated with news and information is crucial for both individuals and businesses. However, the sheer volume of news articles published daily can be overwhelming. Reading and processing these articles is time-consuming, especially when trying to gather insights from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose the development of a text summarization model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model will automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of news articles. Here's how it can benefit the public and support business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Time Efficiency`: People often struggle to find the time to read lengthy news articles. Automated summarization allows individuals to quickly grasp the key points of an article, saving them time while keeping them informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Enhanced Understanding`: Summaries provide a condensed version of the article, making complex topics more accessible to a wider audience. This can help people better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multi-source Insights`: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of a topic, fostering critical thinking and a broader perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Competitive Intelligence`: Businesses can use automated summarization to track news and developments in their industry, enabling them to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to market changes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Market Research`: Summarization can assist in analyzing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies by summarizing customer reviews, news, and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Content Curation`: Media companies and content aggregators can use summarization to curate content for their audience, improving user engagement and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamline and automate the understanding of complex news topics. \n",
    "2. Help track news developments to enhance market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What specific NLP techniques or models can be employed to automate the process of summarizing complex news articles effectively?\n",
    "- How can automation be leveraged to provide real-time updates on important news developments to users or clients?\n",
    "- Are there opportunities to use automation to personalize news content delivery based on individual user preferences and interests?\n",
    "- How can automated summarization and analysis be integrated into other tools or platforms, such as news aggregators or chatbots?\n",
    "- What are the critical news sources, categories, or keywords that have the most significant impact on market trends and consumer sentiment?\n",
    "\n",

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

By iterating through the 'cleaned_summary' column of the DataFrame and checking the number of words in each cleaned summary, the code helps identify how many of these summaries are concise, containing 75 words or less. This analysis is valuable in various natural language processing and text analysis tasks, such as text summarization or information retrieval, as it provides an understanding of the dataset's summarization patterns. Furthermore, it allows data practitioners to assess the suitability of the dataset for specific applications that may have constraints on summary length."

      "Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\n",

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking?

While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. \",\n",

    "## Analysis - Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** measures the proportion of relevant information that our summarization model successfully captures from the source articles and presents in the generated summaries. In our business case, a higher recall score indicates that our model is effective at retrieving and including important content from news articles in the summaries. This is crucial as it ensures that readers and businesses are well-informed and that the generated summaries are a valuable source of information.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROUGE-L Recall Score (0.3002): The ROUGE-L Recall score of 0.3002 indicates that our summarization model captures approximately 30.02% of the content present in the reference \"highlights.\" This signifies that TFIDF model is fairly effective at recalling important content from the reference summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Retrieval: A higher ROUGE-L Recall score suggests that our summarization model is successful at retrieving critical information and core concepts from the source CNN/DailyMail articles. It aligns with our goal of efficiently summarizing news content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Understanding: The ROUGE-L Recall score suggests that the summaries generated by our model provide a substantial amount of information that is present in the reference \"highlights.\" This is valuable for enhancing the understanding of complex news topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supporting Market Research: For our goal of enhancing market research, a higher ROUGE-L Recall score is beneficial. It implies that our model is adept at capturing market-relevant information from the source articles, which is essential for tracking news developments and gaining insights into the business environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Access and Time Efficiency: The high ROUGE-L Recall score indicates that our summarization model efficiently retrieves essential information. This can save time for individuals and businesses as they quickly grasp key points from news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Understanding: The model's ability to capture content from the \"highlights\" enhances the accessibility of complex topics. This is beneficial for individuals looking to better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Critical Thinking and Broader Perspective: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to gain a well-rounded view of a topic. This promotes critical thinking and a broader perspective, aligning with our business case's goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Intelligence and Adaptation: The high ROUGE-L Recall score indicates that businesses can effectively use the generated summaries for competitive intelligence and market research. Staying updated on industry developments and adapting to market changes becomes more feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Research and Content Curation: Summarization supports market research by summarizing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies. Additionally, it facilitates content curation for media companies and content aggregators, ultimately improving user engagement and retention."

    "## BART (large-sized model), fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail\n",
    "BART model pre-trained on English language, and fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail. It was introduced in the paper BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension by Lewis et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model description\n",
    "- BART is a transformer encoder-encoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder. BART is pre-trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering). This particular checkpoint has been fine-tuned on CNN Daily Mail, a large collection of text-summary pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intended uses & limitations\n",
    "You can use this model for text summarization."

    "            The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. \n",

    "            Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . \n",
    "            Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. \n",
    "            His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. \n",
    "            The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. \n",
    "            ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. \n",
    "            Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . \n",
    "            ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. \n",
    "            His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. \n",
    "            Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. \n",
