    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "The increasing volume of news articles and information available on the internet has made it challenging for individuals and businesses to efficiently consume and extract meaningful insights from this vast amount of text data. There is a growing need for an automated text summarization solution that can provide concise and informative summaries of news articles to aid decision-making and save time for readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information age, staying updated with news and information is crucial for both individuals and businesses. However, the sheer volume of news articles published daily can be overwhelming. Reading and processing these articles is time-consuming, especially when trying to gather insights from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose the development of a text summarization model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model will automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of news articles. Here's how it can benefit the public and support business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Time Efficiency`: People often struggle to find the time to read lengthy news articles. Automated summarization allows individuals to quickly grasp the key points of an article, saving them time while keeping them informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Enhanced Understanding`: Summaries provide a condensed version of the article, making complex topics more accessible to a wider audience. This can help people better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multi-source Insights`: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of a topic, fostering critical thinking and a broader perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Benefit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Competitive Intelligence`: Businesses can use automated summarization to track news and developments in their industry, enabling them to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to market changes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Market Research`: Summarization can assist in analyzing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies by summarizing customer reviews, news, and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Content Curation`: Media companies and content aggregators can use summarization to curate content for their audience, improving user engagement and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Risk Assessment`: Summarizing financial news and reports can help financial institutions and investment firms quickly assess risks and opportunities in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this business problem and realize the benefits, the project should aim to accomplish the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Data Collection`: Gather a diverse and comprehensive dataset of news articles across various domains and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Data Preprocessing`: Implement the preprocessing steps outlined, including lowercasing, HTML tag removal, contraction mapping, punctuation removal, stopword removal, and short word removal, to clean and prepare the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Model Development`: Build a text summarization model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks with the specified parameters, including return sequences, return state, and stacked LSTM layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Evaluation`: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) scores or human evaluations to ensure the quality of the generated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Deployment`: Develop a user-friendly interface or API to allow users to input news articles and receive automated summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Testing and Optimization`: Continuously test and optimize the model to improve the quality of the summaries and the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Scalability`: Ensure that the solution can handle a large volume of articles and users, scaling infrastructure as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `Monitoring and Maintenance`: Implement monitoring systems to track model performance over time and provide regular maintenance to keep the summarization service up-to-date and accurate."

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

    "The purpose the code below is to analyze and gain insights into the distribution of summary lengths within a dataset. By iterating through the 'cleaned_summary' column of the DataFrame and checking the number of words in each cleaned summary, the code helps identify how many of these summaries are concise, containing 75 words or less. This analysis is valuable in various natural language processing and text analysis tasks, such as text summarization or information retrieval, as it provides an understanding of the dataset's summarization patterns. Furthermore, it allows data practitioners to assess the suitability of the dataset for specific applications that may have constraints on summary length."

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian.

Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month.

    "# Iteration 2 - KL Model\n",
    "\n",
    "`KL (Kullback-Leibler)` divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from a second, reference probability distribution. In the context of text summarization and natural language processing, KL divergence can be used to measure the difference between two probability distributions of words or terms, typically with the goal of assessing the relevance of a sentence or document to a particular topic or reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "KL divergence between two probability distributions P and Q is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**KL(P || Q) = Σ (P(x) * log(P(x) / Q(x)))**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(x) is the probability of an event x occurring according to distribution P.\n",
    "- Q(x) is the probability of the same event x occurring according to distribution Q.\n",
    "- The sum is taken over all possible events x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL divergence measures the \"divergence\" or \"difference\" between two distributions. It quantifies how much one distribution (P) differs from the other (Q).\n",
    "- KL divergence is not symmetric, meaning KL(P || Q) is not the same as KL(Q || P). The order of the distributions matters.\n",
    "- When KL divergence is zero, it indicates that the two distributions are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### KL Divergence in Text Summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of text summarization, you often have two distributions:\n",
    "- P represents the probability distribution of words in a sentence or document you want to evaluate (e.g., a sentence in the source text).\n",
    "- Q represents the reference distribution, which is typically derived from the entire source document or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to measure how well the words in the sentence (P) align with the overall word distribution in the document (Q).\n",
    "\n",
    "### KL Divergence as a Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use KL divergence as a scoring mechanism to assess the informativeness or relevance of a sentence to the main topics or themes in the document.\n",
    "- A higher KL divergence score implies that the sentence's word distribution significantly differs from the reference distribution, suggesting potential importance or uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence is often used in information retrieval, document summarization, and topic modeling to identify relevant documents or sentences.\n",
    "In text summarization, you might calculate KL divergence for each sentence in the document compared to the document's word distribution. Sentences with higher KL divergence scores are considered more relevant for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence can be sensitive to the size of the text data and can produce noisy results with small amounts of data.\n",
    "It assumes that the two distributions have the same support (i.e., the same set of possible events)."

       "'It is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child: breastfeeding. So lesbian partners Heidi and Maryellen Olson wanted to share that with their first-born Sequoia. They both nurse their one-month-old daughter. Phenomenon: Maryellen Olson, 25, nurses her daughter Sequoia despite not giving birth . Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed \\'co-nursing\\', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn\\'t give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. \\'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,\\' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family\\'s home in Santa Cruz, California. \\'We both feel pretty amazed. \\'It\\'s amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.\\' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi\\'s due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started \\'pumping\\' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman\\'s body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called \\'More Milk Special Blend\\' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. \\'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,\\' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. \\'We get a lot of: \"Wow, that\\'s amazing!\" and \"I didn\\'t know that was possible!\"\\' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor\\'s sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. \\'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,\\' Heidi said. \\'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . \\'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.\\' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn\\'t have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn (\\'she really makes us work for it!\\'). \\'We don\\'t really have a set schedule or rotation,\\' Maryellen said. \\'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.\\' \\'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it\\'s not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.\\' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia\\'s cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: \\'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. \\'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she\\'s been out of the womb and I\\'m breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. \\'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. \\'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn\\'t have were I not breastfeeding.\\''"

    "The two functions, KL and get_Summary, work together to generate a summary from given text using a KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence-based approach. Here's an explanation of what each function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL(sentences, word_pd): This function calculates the sentence scores based on KL divergence. It takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - sentences: a list of sentences from the input text.\n",
    "> - word_pd: a probability distribution of words in the entire document.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each sentence in the sentences list, it first preprocesses the sentence by converting it to lowercase and tokenizing it into words (using preprocessing(sentence.lower())).\n",
    "It then calculates the word frequency of each word in the sentence using a Counter.\n",
    "Next, it computes the probability distribution of words (sent_ps) within the sentence by dividing the word frequency by the total number of words in the sentence.\n",
    "It iterates over each word in the sentence and calculates the KL divergence score for that word with respect to the document-level word probability distribution (word_pd).\n",
    "The KL divergence score for the sentence is calculated as the sum of these word-wise KL divergence scores.\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary (sentence_scores) where the keys are the indices of the sentences in the original sentences list, and the values are the computed KL divergence scores for each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- get_Summary(sentence_scores, no_sentences): This function takes the sentence scores generated by the KL function and the desired number of sentences for the summary (no_sentences) as input. It returns the summary text as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It sorts the sentences in descending order of their KL divergence scores, selecting the top no_sentences sentences with the highest scores. These sentences are considered the most informative for the summary.\n",
    "It then sorts the selected sentences based on their original order in the input text to maintain the original sequence.\n",
    "Finally, it joins these selected sentences into a single summary string and returns it."

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League – although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetsk’s Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. ‘I am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,’ said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . ‘With my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.’ Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""
