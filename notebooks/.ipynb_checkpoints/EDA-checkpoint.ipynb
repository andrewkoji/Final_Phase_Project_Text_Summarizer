    "\n",
    "In this study, we will be analyzing CNN-Daily Mail News Articles. Many companies want to keep track of the latest news trends and reading full length articles can be incredibly time consuming. With the way news headlines affect major business decisions such as legal matters and stock prices, its important that readers are able to obtain all the information and reasoning behind the purpose of these articles and many of them can have a large number of distractors. It's essential that companies that get this information have the ability to quickly analyze these articles and develop counter intel or reports of their own in order to stay current and relevant with today's media. In this study we take the first steps towards utilizing text summarization to fast track the information gathering and counter-reporting process. \n"

    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's information age, staying updated with news and information is crucial for both individuals and businesses. However, the sheer volume of news articles published daily can be overwhelming. Reading and processing these articles is time-consuming, especially when trying to gather insights from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, we propose the development of a text summarization model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This model will automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of news articles. Here's how it can benefit the public and support business decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Time Efficiency`: People often struggle to find the time to read lengthy news articles. Automated summarization allows individuals to quickly grasp the key points of an article, saving them time while keeping them informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Enhanced Understanding`: Summaries provide a condensed version of the article, making complex topics more accessible to a wider audience. This can help people better understand important news and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Multi-source Insights`: Readers can efficiently scan summaries from multiple sources to get a well-rounded view of a topic, fostering critical thinking and a broader perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Competitive Intelligence`: Businesses can use automated summarization to track news and developments in their industry, enabling them to stay ahead of competitors and adapt to market changes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Market Research`: Summarization can assist in analyzing customer sentiment, emerging trends, and competitor strategies by summarizing customer reviews, news, and social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `Content Curation`: Media companies and content aggregators can use summarization to curate content for their audience, improving user engagement and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Streamline and automate the understanding of complex news topics. \n",
    "2. Help track news developments to enhance market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What specific NLP techniques or models can be employed to automate the process of summarizing complex news articles effectively?\n",
    "- How can automation be leveraged to provide real-time updates on important news developments to users or clients?\n",
    "- Are there opportunities to use automation to personalize news content delivery based on individual user preferences and interests?\n",
    "- How can automated summarization and analysis be integrated into other tools or platforms, such as news aggregators or chatbots?\n",
    "- What are the critical news sources, categories, or keywords that have the most significant impact on market trends and consumer sentiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the CNN-Daily Mail News dataset to conduct our study. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail)"

    "\n",
    "To start, we look at a sample article from the dataframe of CNN articles, as well as its reference summary, labeled \"highlights\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the reference summary is to use it in helping determine how well our models perform in generating an effective summary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this business case, the following objectives are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Content Extraction`: The model should accurately extract and prioritize key information from news articles, such as goal tallies, player performances, club interests, and tournament status, similar to what is done in the reference summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Conciseness`: The generated summaries should be concise, avoiding unnecessary details and providing the most important facts. This is crucial for creating efficient news feed content and trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Relevance`: The model should focus on relevant and impactful information to meet the needs of the business case, ensuring that the summaries provide insights that matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Structure`: The generated summaries should be well-structured, possibly using bullet points or other formatting techniques to enhance readability and quick comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Clarity`: The language used in the summaries should be clear and understandable, making the information accessible to a wide audience, including those who may not be experts in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Performance Measurement`: The success of the model can be measured by comparing the generated summaries to reference summaries, just as in your current approach, to assess how effectively it condenses the content and provides valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the desired outcome is to have a summarization model that can efficiently and accurately produce news feed content and trend analysis summaries from public news articles, in a manner that aligns with the characteristics and quality of the reference summary you've provided.\n",

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League â although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetskâs Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. âI am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,â said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . âWith my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.â Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

    "# Getting the word count\n",
    "The purpose of the code below is to provide a quantitative measure of the word count for each article in the DataFrame. Knowing the word count of each article can be valuable for various natural language processing tasks, such as text summarization, where you might want to generate a concise summary of the content while preserving essential information or meeting a specific length requirement. By having the word count readily available in the 'WordCount' column, you can make informed decisions and apply algorithms or methods that take the length of the text into account during the summarization process, ensuring that the generated summaries are of an appropriate length.\n",

       "\"Tyra Banks made her awards ceremony hosting debut on Sunday at the Daytime Emmy Awards in Burbank, California and delivered on her promise of multiple outfits. The 41-year-old model and television personality also premiered a new short hairdo at the awards ceremony honouring the best in daytime television. Matt Lauer received plenty of thanks during the two-hour broadcast on the Pop basic cable network after a comedy bit featuring pasties and black stockings. Scroll down for video . Hosting debut: Tyra Banks made her awards ceremony hosting debut on Sunday at the 42nd annual Daytime Emmy Awards in Burbank, California . The host of NBC's The Today Show in a pre-taped skit with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres agreed to end their pranking feud. The two were on opposite coasts and in the dual screen bit Ellen promised not to edit the video. Matt however was then shown with his head superimposed over the body of a chiseled man wearing only tasseled pasties, black briefs and lace-topped stockings. Multiple looks: The America's Next Top Model host promised the audience several outfit changes . She's a natural: Tyra moved the show along as it returned to television after streaming online last year . As Ellen grinned away at the racy image Matt pledged to donate $1,000 to charity each time a winner thanked him in their acceptance speech. Early award winner Nancy O'Dell thanked Matt three times after Entertainment Tonight took home the gong for Outstanding Entertainment News Program. Most of the winners also thanked 57-year-old Matt as they accepted their awards.

    "The purpose the code below is to analyze and gain insights into the distribution of summary lengths within a dataset. By iterating through the 'cleaned_summary' column of the DataFrame and checking the number of words in each cleaned summary, the code helps identify how many of these summaries are concise, containing 75 words or less. This analysis is valuable in various natural language processing and text analysis tasks, such as text summarization or information retrieval, as it provides an understanding of the dataset's summarization patterns. Furthermore, it allows data practitioners to assess the suitability of the dataset for specific applications that may have constraints on summary length."

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League â although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetskâs Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. âI am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,â said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . âWith my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.â Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

      "Original Summary: \n",
      "This 4x4 from Russia is a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover .\n",
      "Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears .\n",
      "But, forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone .\n",
      "A highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia â for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover.\n",
      "It's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd, with high suspension, pressed steel wheels, Soviet-style looks and real rarity value. Expect to get gawped at: someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out. Always fun.\n",
      "Now available in the UK from Niva imports through its dealer, BB Motors, in Corby, Northamptonshire (01536 202207, lada4x4.co.uk).\n",
      "On the road, the basic 1.7-litre petrol engine (your only option) is deafeningly noisy, but tolerably smooth. Power steering, manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run.\n",
      "The seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors, all-round visibility is good. Top speed is 91 mph.\n",
      "Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears, differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction.Â It is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big-name utility 4x4s, with 220mm ground clearance, a 600mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent. Tall, slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky.\n",
      "You won't have to agonise over pages of extras... they're more or less nonexistent. This is a very basic utility vehicle, after all.\n",
      "Choose in white, blue, green or red, then decide whether you'd like the snorkel or snow plough (really) attachments. An LPG option is available for an extra Â£999 â but you lose boot space.\n",
      "Reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure â once you've explained exactly what it is. Meets Euro 5 emissions standards. The heated blower, presumably designed with Siberia in mind, has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings.\n",
      "Also available in a compact van format (Â£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax).\n",
      "Spartan on the inside. Forget luxuries such as radios, cup-holders, central locking and electric windows â the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone.Â The upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud, and there's not much to break or go wrong.\n",
      "There are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot.\n",
      "Don't trust the petrol gauge, which regularly aims to deceive.\n",
      "No warranty is offered as standard â although a two-year plan is coming soon â and spares may need to be imported (BB Motors will assist).\n",
      "Only available in lefthand drive â unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them!\n",
      "Shhhh! You didn't hear it from me. But patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big play of driving a Lada Niva back in 2009 â but fitted it with a German engine.\n"

With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk.

More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking?

    "# Iteration 2 - KL Model\n",
    "\n",
    "`KL (Kullback-Leibler)` divergence is a measure of how one probability distribution differs from a second, reference probability distribution. In the context of text summarization and natural language processing, KL divergence can be used to measure the difference between two probability distributions of words or terms, typically with the goal of assessing the relevance of a sentence or document to a particular topic or reference distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "KL divergence between two probability distributions P and Q is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**KL(P || Q) = Î£ (P(x) * log(P(x) / Q(x)))**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(x) is the probability of an event x occurring according to distribution P.\n",
    "- Q(x) is the probability of the same event x occurring according to distribution Q.\n",
    "- The sum is taken over all possible events x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- KL divergence measures the \"divergence\" or \"difference\" between two distributions. It quantifies how much one distribution (P) differs from the other (Q).\n",
    "- KL divergence is not symmetric, meaning KL(P || Q) is not the same as KL(Q || P). The order of the distributions matters.\n",
    "- When KL divergence is zero, it indicates that the two distributions are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### KL Divergence in Text Summarization:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of text summarization, you often have two distributions:\n",
    "- P represents the probability distribution of words in a sentence or document you want to evaluate (e.g., a sentence in the source text).\n",
    "- Q represents the reference distribution, which is typically derived from the entire source document or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to measure how well the words in the sentence (P) align with the overall word distribution in the document (Q).\n",
    "\n",
    "### KL Divergence as a Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use KL divergence as a scoring mechanism to assess the informativeness or relevance of a sentence to the main topics or themes in the document.\n",
    "- A higher KL divergence score implies that the sentence's word distribution significantly differs from the reference distribution, suggesting potential importance or uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence is often used in information retrieval, document summarization, and topic modeling to identify relevant documents or sentences.\n",
    "In text summarization, you might calculate KL divergence for each sentence in the document compared to the document's word distribution. Sentences with higher KL divergence scores are considered more relevant for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "KL divergence can be sensitive to the size of the text data and can produce noisy results with small amounts of data.\n",
    "It assumes that the two distributions have the same support (i.e., the same set of possible events)."

Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed \\'co-nursing\\', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn\\'t give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. \\'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,\\' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family\\'s home in Santa Cruz, California. \\'We both feel pretty amazed. \\'It\\'s amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.\\' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi\\'s due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started \\'pumping\\' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman\\'s body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called \\'More Milk Special Blend\\' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. \\'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,\\' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. \\'We get a lot of: \"Wow, that\\'s amazing!\" and \"I didn\\'t know that was possible!\"\\' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor\\'s sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. \\'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,\\' Heidi said. \\'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . \\'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.\\' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn\\'t have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn (\\'she really makes us work for it!\\'). \\'We don\\'t really have a set schedule or rotation,\\' Maryellen said. \\'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.\\' \\'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it\\'s not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.\\' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia\\'s cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: \\'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. \\'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she\\'s been out of the womb and I\\'m breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. \\'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. \\'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn\\'t have were I not breastfeeding.\\''"

    "The two functions, KL and get_Summary, work together to generate a summary from given text using a KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence-based approach. Here's an explanation of what each function does:\n",

    "> - word_pd: a probability distribution of words in the entire document.\n",
    "\n",

    "It then calculates the word frequency of each word in the sentence using a Counter.\n",
    "Next, it computes the probability distribution of words (sent_ps) within the sentence by dividing the word frequency by the total number of words in the sentence.\n",
    "It iterates over each word in the sentence and calculates the KL divergence score for that word with respect to the document-level word probability distribution (word_pd).\n",
    "The KL divergence score for the sentence is calculated as the sum of these word-wise KL divergence scores.\n",
    "The function returns a dictionary (sentence_scores) where the keys are the indices of the sentences in the original sentences list, and the values are the computed KL divergence scores for each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- get_Summary(sentence_scores, no_sentences): This function takes the sentence scores generated by the KL function and the desired number of sentences for the summary (no_sentences) as input. It returns the summary text as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It sorts the sentences in descending order of their KL divergence scores, selecting the top no_sentences sentences with the highest scores. These sentences are considered the most informative for the summary.\n",
    "It then sorts the selected sentences based on their original order in the input text to maintain the original sequence.\n",
    "Finally, it joins these selected sentences into a single summary string and returns it."

       "\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will go head-to-head once more in the race to be this season's top scorer in the Champions League â although Luiz Adriano threatens to spoil the party. Both Barcelona and Real Madrid booked their spots in the semi-finals this week with victories over Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid respectively. The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetskâs Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. âI am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,â said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future. Adriano, who netted five times against BATE Borisov in the group, has scored more goals than any other player in the Champions League... he is out of contract in December and could move to the Premier League . âWith my contract set to expire and many good performances, it'll be difficult to stay in Ukraine.â Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Adriano in recent months, while Liverpool are also keen on the Brazilian. His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals. The draw for the last four will take place on Friday.\""

A precision of 0.1328 means that, on average, only about 13.28% of the unigrams in the generated summaries are also present in the reference summaries. This suggests that the generated summaries may include a lot of extraneous or incorrect words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ROUGE-1 Recall (0.2850):` Recall measures the proportion of overlapping unigrams in the reference summaries that are also present in the generated summaries. A recall of 0.2850 means that, on average, the system is capturing about 28.50% of the unigrams from the reference summaries. This suggests that the generated summaries may be missing a significant portion of important information from the source articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ROUGE-1 F1 Score (0.1751):` The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. In this case, it's 0.1751, which indicates that there's a trade-off between precision and recall. The system is not achieving a good balance between capturing relevant information and avoiding irrelevant information.\n",

    "- `ROUGE-L Precision (0.1249):` ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence between the generated and reference summaries. A precision of 0.1249 suggests that, on average, only about 12.49% of the longest common subsequences in the generated summaries match those in the reference summaries. This again indicates that the generated summaries may not be effectively capturing the essence of the source articles.\n",

A recall of 0.2679 suggests that the system is capturing about 26.79% of the longest common subsequences in the reference summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ROUGE-L F1 Score (0.1647):` The F1 score for ROUGE-L, like ROUGE-1, is low at 0.1647, indicating a suboptimal balance between precision and recall."

The planet's best footballers have scored eight times in Europe this season. But Shakhtar Donetskâs Adriano, courted by Arsenal and Liverpool, has netted on nine occasions this term. Cristiano Ronaldo, in action against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening, has scored eight goals in Europe . Lionel Messi also has eight goals in the Champions League this term; one fewer than Luiz Adriano . Ronaldo and Messi will both play at least two more times after Real Madrid and Barcelona reached the last four . Adriano, who moved to Donetsk in 2007, scored five against BATE Borsiov in the group stages. His performance that night made history, with the 27-year-old becoming only the second player to score five times in a Champions League game. The other was Messi for Barcelona against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012. He also scored the third quickest hat-trick in the competition's history (12 minutes) as the Ukrainian side, knocked out by Bayern Munich in the round of 16, racked up the biggest-ever half-time lead (6-0) in Europe's premier tournament. âI am in a good moment of my career and we'll do what will be best for me and for the club,â said Adriano last month when quizzed over his future.

His contract with Shakhtar Donetsk runs out at the end of the year. Ronaldo and Messi however, remain in pole-position to top the scoring charts with Barcelona and Real Madrid both in the hat for the two-legged semi-finals to be played next month. Of the teams still in the pot, Neymar and Luis Suarez of Barcelona, Real Madrid's Karim Benzema and former Manchester United and City striker Carlos Tevez, now plying his trade for Juventus, each have six goals.
